# Deploy Cloud Foundry on Azure

In Microsoft Azure, there are serveral different environments, such as AzureCloud for global Azure, AzureUSGovernment for Azure Government, and AzureChinaCloud for Azure operated by 21Vianet in China.

This document describes how to deploy [BOSH](http://bosh.io/) and [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) on [AzureCloud](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), [AzureChinaCloud](https://www.azure.cn/) and [AzureUSGovernment](http://www.azure.com/gov).

# 1 Prerequisites
